Hey there! I'm Sarah, the founder of a growing food delivery startup called "QuickBite." We're doing pretty well locally but I'm drowning in manual processes and our current system is held together with duct tape and prayers.

### Here's what I need from you:
I need a proper backend system that can handle our food delivery operations. Right now everything is scattered across Google Sheets, WhatsApp groups, and a basic WordPress site. It's a mess.

### The Details:

- A REST API that can handle customer orders, restaurant management, and delivery tracking
- User authentication for customers, restaurant owners, and delivery drivers
- Real-time order status updates
- Integration with payment gateways (we're thinking Stripe)
- Some kind of admin dashboard where I can see all orders, manage restaurants, and track performance
- A system to calculate delivery fees based on distance
- Basic inventory management for restaurants

### Current Pain Points:

- Orders come in through our app but I have to manually call restaurants
- Drivers text me when they pick up/deliver orders - I need to track this properly
- No way to see our daily/weekly revenue without manually adding everything up
- Customers keep calling asking "where's my food?" because they can't track orders
- Restaurant owners want to update their menus but have to call me every time

### Technical Requirements:

- Needs to be scalable - we're planning to expand to 3 more cities this year
- Should be secure (obviously)
- Fast response times - customers hate waiting
- Easy to maintain because my budget for ongoing development is limited

### Timeline:
I need this done in 6-8 weeks. I know it sounds tight, but our current system is literally breaking down daily.

### Budget:
I can pay $8,000-$12,000 for this project, depending on exactly what gets delivered.
